Sanghelios, also known as Urs IV[8] and designated CE-80-9012 d by the Forerunners,[9] is the homeworld of the Sangheili species. Sanghelios is the fourth planet in the Urs system, a triple star system containing Urs, Fied, and Joori. The planet is orbited by two natural satellites, Qikost and Suban.[3] Sanghelios is a world with a very militaristic and feudal society, a result of the planet's harsh environment.[10]

As a space-faring species, the Sangheili have colonized multiple worlds in addition to Sanghelios as they expanded the reach of their own civilization and later the empire of the Covenant.[11] Though the Sangheili have colonized dozens of independent worlds, Sanghelios still remains central to the government and culture of the species.[12] Following the Human-Covenant War and the dissolution of the Covenant, Sanghelios had become embroiled in a civil war known as the Blooding Years that encompasses most of the planet and many Sangheili colonies.[1] Though the Swords of Sanghelios have effectively taken control of the planet, many other factions seek to overthrow the government.[6]
