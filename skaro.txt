Skaro was the homeworld of the Thals, of the Kaleds, and infamously, of the Daleks. The latter came to be during the Thousand Year War between the Thals and Kaleds because of the actions of the Kaled scientist Davros. After its devastation and irradiation during this war, Skaro became uninhabitable to humanoids without regular anti-radioactivity drug treatments. Subsequent attacks on the planet caused by the Dalek presence would nearly destroy it, but eventually, Skaro was remade by the Daleks and became the centre of the Dalek Empire once more.
